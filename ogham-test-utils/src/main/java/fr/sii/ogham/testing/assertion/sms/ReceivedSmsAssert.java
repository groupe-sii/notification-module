	 * <pre>
	 * .receivedMessages().message(0)

	 * <pre>
	 * .receivedMessages().every()
	 *                       .content(is("foobar"))
	 * </pre>

	 * 
	 * <pre>

	 *                       .content(is("foobar"))

	 *                       .from().number(is("+33102030405"))
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * Will check that content of every message is "foobar" and that phone
	 * nuumber of sender of first received message is "+33102030405".
