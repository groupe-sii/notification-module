/**
 * Ogham provides {@link ResourceResolver}s to resolve a resource from a
 * {@link ResourcePath}. However, template engines also have their resource
 * resolution algorithms. Therefore, Ogham provides adapters between Ogham
 * resource management and template engine resource management. When template
 * engine tries to resolve a template/resource, it uses one of the adapters.
 * 
 * This is a general exception that has subclasses to indicate the reason why
 * the adapter has failed.
