 * As a template path may be only partial (without extension), the only way to

 * if it exists.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, if there are two template engines registered with associated
 * mappings: Thymeleaf registered with ".html" and ".xhtml" extensions and
 * Freemarker registered with ".html.ftl" and ".html.ftlh".
 * 
 * If the path of the template is "register", it is impossible to know if the
 * right template is "register.html", "register.xhtml", "register.html.ftl" or
 * "register.html.ftlh" without checking if it exists.
 * 
 * So each possible path is tried and the first path that matches an existing
 * resource is used.
