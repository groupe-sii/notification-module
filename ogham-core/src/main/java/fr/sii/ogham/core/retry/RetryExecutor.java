/**
 * Execute an action until it succeeds or the maximum retries are reached.
 * 
 * The retry management is handled by a {@link RetryStrategy} strategy. This
 * strategy indicates when the next try (next call of the action) should operate
 * and when the retries must stop.
 * 
 * For example, if the retry strategy is {@link FixedDelayRetry} with a 500ms
 * delay and 5 max retries, it means that a retry will be attempted every 500ms
 * until 5 attempts are reached (inclusive). For example, you want to connect to
 * an external system at t1=0 and the connection timeout (100ms) is triggered at
 * t2=100ms. Using this retry will provide the following behavior:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>0: connect</li>
 * <li>100: timeout</li>
 * <li>600: connect</li>
 * <li>700: timeout</li>
 * <li>1200: connect</li>
 * <li>1300: timeout</li>
 * <li>1800: connect</li>
 * <li>1900: timeout</li>
 * <li>2400: connect</li>
 * <li>2500: timeout</li>
 * <li>3000: connect</li>
 * <li>3100: timeout</li>
 * <li>fail</li>
 * </ul>
