/**
 * General exception that indicates that the action to retry has failed. It has
 * several subclasses to indicate the reason why it failed:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ExecutionFailedNotRetriedException}: the action has failed but no
 * retry was requested</li>
 * <li>{@link ExecutionFailureWrapper}: wraps another exception and adds
 * additional information about the action execution that has failed</li>
 * <li>{@link MaximumAttemptsReachedException}: the action has been retried too
 * many times</li>
 * <li>{@link RetryExecutionInterruptedException}: the thread that runs the
 * action has been interrupted</li>
 * <li>{@link UnrecoverableException}: the action has thrown an exception that
 * should not be ignored so no more retry should be attempted</li>
 * </ul>
