package fr.sii.ogham.core.retry;

import java.time.Instant;

/**
 * Retry several times with a fixed delay between each try until the maximum
 * attempts is reached. The next execution is based on the execution start date.
 * 
 * If delay is 500ms and max retries is 5, it means that a retry will be
 * attempted every 500ms until 5 attempts are reached (inclusive). For example,
 * you want to connect to an external system at t1=0 and the connection timeout
 * (100ms) is triggered at t2=100ms. Using this retry will provide the following
 * behavior:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>0: connect</li>
 * <li>100: timeout</li>
 * <li>500: connect</li>
 * <li>600: timeout</li>
 * <li>1000: connect</li>
 * <li>1100: timeout</li>
 * <li>1500: connect</li>
 * <li>1600: timeout</li>
 * <li>2000: connect</li>
 * <li>2100: timeout</li>
 * <li>2500: connect</li>
 * <li>2600: timeout</li>
 * <li>fail</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * 
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> The provided date doesn't take the duration of the
 * execution in account. If an execution takes 1s to execute while retry delay
 * is set to 500ms, there may have several executions in parallel. However, this
 * totally depends on the {@link RetryExecutor} implementation. For example
 * {@link SimpleRetryExecutor} won't run several executions in parallel. In this
 * case, it will execute the action as soon as the previous one has failed
 * therefore the delay may not be complied.
