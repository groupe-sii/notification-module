/**
 * Adapter interface to be able to handle any Mime Type detection
 * implementation. There exists two kinds of detection mechanisms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Detection based on the file extension:
 * <ul>
 * <li>+ Basic mapping based on extension</li>
 * <li>+ Fast</li>
 * <li>- Wrong Mime Type if extension is changed</li>
 * <li>- There is a long list of extensions</li>
 * <li>- Same extension corresponds to different Mime Types</li>
 * <li>- Can't be used on stream or string because the extension is unknown</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Detection based on magic numbers (read the first bytes of the file):
 * <ul>
 * <li>+ Based on the real content</li>
 * <li>+ Does not depend on the extension</li>
 * <li>+ Can be used on streams or strings</li>
 * <li>- Fast but not as fast as file extension detection</li>
 * <li>- Need also a long list of mappings</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This interface reconcile both approaches. It lets the implementation choose
 * which approach to use. Some implementations can't handle both approaches so
 * they have to delegate to another one to be able to implement both detection
 * mechanisms.
