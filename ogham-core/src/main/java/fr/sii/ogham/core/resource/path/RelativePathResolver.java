 * Resolve the given path against the base path by using the following rules:

 * If the <b>relative path</b> is not absolute (doesn't start with /) and the
 * <b>base path</b> ends with / then the <b>relative path</b> is
 * <b>appended</b> to the <b>base path</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <b>relative path</b> is not absolute (doesn't start with /) and the
 * <b>base path</b> doesn't end with / then the <b>relative path</b>
 * <b>replaces</b> the last part of the <b>base path</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <b>relative path</b> is absolute (starts with /) then the <b>relative
 * path</b> is is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <b>relative path</b> has lookup prefix (like "classpath:") then this
 * lookup prefix is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <b>relative path</b> has no lookup prefix then the lookup prefix of
 * <b>base path</b> is used (if any).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the <b>relative path</b> has different lookup prefix than <b>base
 * path</b> lookup then relative path is considered like an absolute path.
