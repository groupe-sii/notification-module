/**
 * Builder that configures how configuration properties are handled.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The user can use either system properties or custom properties or properties
 * loaded from a file. The user can also mix them. For example, he can use
 * system properties and custom properties.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The user can also configure how conversions are applied to properties
 * (converting a string that comes from properties into an integer for example).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, the user can also use a custom {@link PropertyResolver} (the
 * property resolver is the abstraction used to read properties).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Built {@link PropertyResolver} will then be used in almost every builder to
 * evaluate property keys (in the form of "${custom.property}").
