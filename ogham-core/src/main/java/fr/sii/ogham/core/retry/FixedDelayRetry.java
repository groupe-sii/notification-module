/**
 * Retry several times with a fixed delay to wait after the last execution
 * failure until the maximum attempts is reached.
 * 
 * If delay is 500ms and max retries is 5, it means that a retry will be
 * attempted every 500ms until 5 attempts are reached (inclusive). For example,
 * you want to connect to an external system at t1=0 and the connection timeout
 * (100ms) is triggered at t2=100ms. Using this retry will provide the following
 * behavior:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>0: connect</li>
 * <li>100: timeout</li>
 * <li>600: connect</li>
 * <li>700: timeout</li>
 * <li>1200: connect</li>
 * <li>1300: timeout</li>
 * <li>1800: connect</li>
 * <li>1900: timeout</li>
 * <li>2400: connect</li>
 * <li>2500: timeout</li>
 * <li>3000: connect</li>
 * <li>3100: timeout</li>
 * <li>fail</li>
 * </ul>
