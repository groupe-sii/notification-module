/**
 * Enable mimetype detection using <a href="http://tika.apache.org/">Apache
 * Tika</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Tika is able to detect mimetype either based on file extension or based on
 * stream content. Tika is enough smart to try several algorithms (extension,
 * magic headers...).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Even if several algorithms are used, Tika may not detect mimetype and in this
 * case {@code application/octet-stream} mimetype is returned by Tika. The
 * builder let you make detection fail if {@code application/octet-stream} is
 * returned (see {@link TikaBuilder#failIfOctetStream(boolean)}). This is useful
 * in order to try detection with another implementation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If no Tika instance is explicitly provided, default Tika instance is used
 * (see {@link Tika} and {@link TikaConfig#getDefaultConfig})
