== Introduction

include::{user-manual-dir}/introduction.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Quick start

=== Standalone

include::{user-manual-dir}/installation/standalone-all.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== With Spring Boot

.Getting started with Spring Boot
[%collapsible]
==========
include::{user-manual-dir}/installation/springboot-all.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
==========

== Select the features you need

Importing `ogham-all` dependency or `ogham-spring-boot-starter-all` dependency 
is easy but may import dependencies that you
don't need. For example, you may only need FreeMarker but not Thymeleaf. Or
you may only need to send emails through SMTP but never use SendGrid.

See how to {current-version-site-base-url}/user-manual.html#select-features-standalone[select features].


== Usage

[NOTE]
====
All samples with templates are using ThymeLeaf as template engine. For FreeMarker samples, 
take a look at {current-version-site-base-url}/user-manual.html#freemarker[FreeMarker section].
====

=== Send Email

[NOTE]
====
The samples are available in the {standard-samples-url}[sample-standard-usage sub-project].

All samples shown bellow are using SMTP for sending email. 
See {current-version-site-base-url}/user-manual.html#sendgrid[Sending email through SendGrid] 
to know how to send email using SendGrid HTTP API.
====

==== First email using an existing SMTP server


:note-caption: :grey_question:
[NOTE]
====
This sample demonstrates a basic usage of Ogham. This sample doesn't 
show real improvement compared to other libraries. However, it is a
the base for understanding the other samples.

==== Use HTML title as email subject

:note-caption: :grey_question:
[NOTE]
====
This sample demonstrates that you can use a single source for both the body and
the subject (same variables and same context). This is particularly useful
for internationalization.

images as usual without worrying about technical concerns and limitations for
such resources in email context.

=== Send SMS

[NOTE]
====
The samples are available in the {standard-samples-url}[sample-standard-usage sub-project].

All samples shown bellow are using SMPP for sending SMS. 
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Peer-to-Peer[SMPP] protocol 
is the standard way to send SMS. Only a subset of SMPP properties are used 
in following samples. The whole list of SMPP properties is available 
in {current-version-site-base-url}/user-manual.html#advanced-smpp-configuration[advanced configuration].

See {current-version-site-base-url}/user-manual.html#ovh[Sending SMS through OVH] to know how to send SMS using OVH HTTP API.
