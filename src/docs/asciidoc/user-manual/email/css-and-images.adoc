When you develop a Web application, you can use HTML for the content and CSS for layout and theming. HTML and CSS can use images to make a beautiful Web page. Each concern is separated in a different file. This is a good practice.

However, writing an HTML email is totally different. Indeed, email clients are not as evolved as Web browsers. Even worse, some clients disable some features on purpose (like Inbox that prevents using `style` tag). To make an email work on several clients, you should follow these rules:

* `<img>` tags that use local images must be embedded
* Use XHTML instead of HTML
* Remove HTML comments (except conditional comments used to target Outlook)
* Add border=0 on all images to avoid an ugly border
* Do not write shortcut CSS values (`padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px;` instead of `padding: 4px`)
* Padding is not supported on some clients so you must use margins instead (adding a parent just for the layout)
* Background images on body should be moved on another node
* CSS3 properties are not supported
* Images must have `alt` attribute
* ...

There are many other rules but the developer should not be constrained and should be able to write its HTML and CSS like as usual in Web browsers. Ogham simplifies image and CSS integration and is able to partially rewrite the HTML.

TODO: explanation from old README
#### Working with HTML content

To be sure that most of Email clients will handle an HTML content, there are many rules to follow when writing the content. They might be very complex and time consuming. The library do all this headache work for you.

All these features can be either disabled or use another implementation instead of the default one.

##### Inline CSS and images

For Web developers, it is important to write clean code and separate the concerns. So when writing HTML, developers want to externalize CSS files and images. This is also really important to mutualize the code of CSS files and images for reuse.

However, email clients doesn't handle external CSS files. Styles can be included in a `style` tag but Gmail doesn't support it. So all rules provided in the CSS *MUST* be inlined directly in the HTML. Writing code like this is just awful and error prone. Moreover, images can be references externally but there are many constraints to use it this way. You have to know in advance what is the URL of the final image. And even then, the email client might block those images for safety purpose. Not mentioning offline issues.

The library will automatically inlines CSS rules directly on the HTML tags. The images are either inlined as base64 encoded in `img` `src` attribute or images are attached with the email (with inline content disposition and references in the HTML).

##### Use expanded CSS properties

CSS properties can be written using shorthand version:
```css
padding: 4px 2px;
```
This is equivalent to:
```css
padding: 4px 2px 4px 2px;
```

Some email clients do not understand shorthand properties. So all properties written in shorthand version must be expanded in order to work everywhere.

The library will automatically expand properties from shorthand versions.

##### Add extra attributes for old email clients

Several attributes must be added on some HTML tags in order to be compliant with email clients. For example, tables and images must have attribute `border="0"`in order to prevent an ugly border on some clients.

The library will automatically add these attributes.

##### Use XHTML

It is recommended to write XHTML instead of HTML due to some mail clients. The library do it for you.

##### Background images

Background images are not correctly handled by several mail clients. And again, some workarounds to apply to fix this issue.

The library will apply those workarounds to your HTML.

##### Use tables for layouts

////

Here is the list of supported transformations:

* [x] `<img>` tags that use local images are embedded (using `cid` reference)
* [x] `<img>` tags that use local images are embedded (using base64 data URI)
* [ ] Use XHTML instead of HTML
* [ ] Tables used for layout explicitly set default values
* [ ] Remove HTML comments (except conditional comments used to target Outlook)
* [ ] Add border=0 on all images to avoid an ugly border
* [ ] Do not write shortcut CSS values (`padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px;` instead of `padding: 4px`)
* [ ] Padding is not supported on some clients so you must use margins instead (adding a parent just for the layout)
* [ ] Background images on body should be moved on another node
* [ ] Images must have `alt` attribute
