This is a simple implementation that runs in the current thread (no thread is created).
It executes the action and if it fails, it suspends the current thread (using an `Awaiter` implementation)
for some time (configured through <<user-manual.adoc#retry-strategy, `RetryStrategy`>>).

It repeats that until either the it succeeds or the maximum attempts is reached (or the strategy indicates
that it should stop).
