Session (connection between the client and the server) may be handled in many ways. Ogham natively
provides three strategies:

* Always use a new session for each message
* Reuse same session for several messages until the connection is lost
* Actively keep the session alive

This section explains the difference between each implementation, how it works and how to use it.
