	 * for you. It avoids to explicitly write the whole path and let you change
	 * the resource resolution easily.
	 * 
	 * For example, you have one template located into
	 * "/foo/template/createAccount.html" and you have one template located into
	 * "/foo/template/resetPassword.html".
	 * 
	 * So you can set the prefix path to "/foo/template/". You can now reference
	 * the templates using only the file name: "createAccount.html" and
	 * "resetPassword.html".
	 * 
	 * Path prefix can be set globally, by template engine, by sending system
	 * and by resolver. For example, the priority order for classpath is (from
	 * highest priority to lowest): (1)
	 * ogham.email.freemarker.classpath.path-prefix, (2)
	 * ogham.email.template.classpath.path-prefix, (3)
	 * ogham.email.freemarker.path-prefix, (4) ogham.email.template.path-prefix,
