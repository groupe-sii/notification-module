 * <li>A session can be reused if possible until no message has been sent for a
 * while (useful when several messages have to be sent in a row)</li>
 * <li>Keep the session always alive (useful when application needs to send
 * messages quickly and often)</li>
 * <li>...</li>

 * This interface defines the entrypoints that need to be implemented to handle
